# parser-tablature

This is an [ascii music tablature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII_tab) grammar for the [lezer](https://lezer.codemirror.net/) parser system.

It currently only parses tablature for stringed instrument like guitar or bass, but it is planned to become a more instrument-agnostic parser for music tablature, with the semantic details of each instrument type handled by the [tab-state](https://github.com/tab-edit/tab-state) project
