guiding principle:
try to abstract as much as possible, avoiding being instrument-specific (e.g. define a line name as just 4 characters, starting with a letter, and containing letters or numbers)


NoteConnectors should not have a nested structure. The connectors should be their own 


measurelines should be defined as (one or two |'s that have no space inbetween) followed by (measure contents i.e. dashes, frets, e.t.c.)
then you should have an open-measureline token/rule which is defined as 

measures should be defined as such, without spacing:
name measurelines (one or two |'s that have no space inbetween)

we want to generify as much as possible(instrument-agnostic), so maybe definition of a component should be:
[a-zA-Z\[{(] followed by a note followed by [\[{(]
we use lookahead to distinguish connector from component. that way, we can gave g both as a connector and as a component.

on second thought, maybe not the best idea, because then we can't have leading connector right before a note if it can be misinterpreted as a component.

e.g. these two would be inconsistent even though they should be the same: |--7-g5| and |--7-g-5|. g is a component in one and a connector in the other. not consistent.
